<p>An automatic extension gives you an extra two days to complete a particular assessment. You don't need to give us a reason, you just need to ask for it before the cut off date.</p>
<h3 style="background: #e7f0f3; border-bottom: solid .2em #a6c8d4; padding: .6em .6em .6em 1.2em; border-radius: 3em;">How do I get an automatic extension?</h3>
<p>Fill in one of the request forms on this page. Make sure you check that it's for the correct assessment! You'll get an email confirming that your extension has been granted.</p>
<h3 style="background: #e7f0f3; border-bottom: solid .2em #a6c8d4; padding: .6em .6em .6em 1.2em; border-radius: 3em;">When do I have to request it by?</h3>
<p>You have to request your extension <strong>at least 72 hours</strong> (three days) before the due date. So if the assessments are due on Monday at 5 pm, you need to make your request before Friday at 5 pm</p>
<h3 style="background: #e7f0f3; border-bottom: solid .2em #a6c8d4; padding: .6em .6em .6em 1.2em; border-radius: 3em;">What happens if I miss the request date?</h3>
<p>If you miss the request date, <strong>only</strong> those of you who have a genuine, unexpected emergencey will be granted an extension. This will be <strong>strictly enforced</strong>.</p>
<p>Having to move house, getting a cold, or being called into work is <strong>not</strong> an emergency. Child care arrangements falling through, emergency medical situations, significant break-ups <strong>do</strong> count as an emergency, at least the first time.</p>
<p>You're welcome to request an extension just in case, even if you don't think you'll need it.</p>
<h3 style="background: #e7f0f3; border-bottom: solid .2em #a6c8d4; padding: .6em .6em .6em 1.2em; border-radius: 3em;">Why are you being so nice about extensions, but so mean about the request date?</h3>
<p>We recognise that we all have things going on in our lives beside this course (even your instructors do!), so we have no problem giving you a few extra days if you need them. However, we also think that being able to predict your upcoming workload is part of learning time management skills, so we think it is important that you are responsible for making the request on time. You're welcome to</p>
