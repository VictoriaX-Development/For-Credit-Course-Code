<p>Some of this material will be useful for filling gaps in your knowledge about llamas, and some will be useful for those who want to extend their knowledge into more depth than this course covers.  <strong>None of this will be assessed</strong>, but you might find they help you do better on your assessments.  We encourage you to take responsibility for your learning and make use of these resources as and when you need them.</p>
